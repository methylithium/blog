I am freaking lazy, I hate myself for being not so lazy, but tha fact I want everything. I want to write cool programs, I want to make at least any music, I want to make yoga and make healthy food for everyday. Laziness is not a problem. I just want to stop wishing to master everything and just be okay with the fact I'm doing nothing... I want to normalize in my mind that not being able to do cool stuff or have great skill is bad. I am so tired of this duality.
