Okay. I tried to make a realistic goal. But I still can't decide. I love music, but I am so lazy to watch music production tutorials. Then I want to make an app, or achieve a level when I will be able to make apps. Next, poker. I love playing p0k3r, but playing tournaments is so hard. I easily become so fatigued. Probably I will be able to achive my goals 
- make a web app
- produce a simple song
- win a cool poker tournament

something like this
